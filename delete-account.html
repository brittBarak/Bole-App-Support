# Delete Your Bole Account

If you wish to delete your Bole account and all associated data, you can do so directly from within the Bole app.

## How to Delete Your Account
1. Open the **Bole** app.
2. Go to your **Profile** section.
3. Tap **Delete Account**.
4. Confirm your choice.

Once you confirm, your account and all associated personal data will be **permanently deleted within 24 hours**.  
This is an **irreversible action**, and your data cannot be recovered after deletion.

## What Data Is Deleted
When you delete your account, we permanently remove:
- Your account information (name, email, and profile details)
- Any activity or content associated with your account

Some minimal, non-personal information (e.g., aggregated analytics) may be retained for up to 90 days for system integrity and legal compliance.
